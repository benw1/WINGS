Make_targets -> finds catalogs and makes target for each
   fires event for each catalog in each target
   includes total number of catalogs in each target
Process catalog
   Each new catalog event starts this
   processes catalog into proper STIPS input
   increases the target's catalog option from Make_targets when done
   When reaches total number of catalogs fires event for each STIPS run
   includes total number of STIPS runs
Run stips and tag output*
   Runs the STIPS input catalog specified in event
   Tags the output image
   increases the target's stips_run option from process catalog
   When reaches total number of stips runs, fires event for each band
   includes total number of bands
Astrodrizzle?*
   Run some kind of code on stack in each band to identify bad pixels
   not sure if we'll need this for an IR detector...
   increment number of bands option frm run_stips
   when reaches total number of filters, count all images in target, 
   fire an event for each image
   includes total number of images
Prep image
   run dolphot prep steps on the image specified by the event
   tag data products
   increment number of images option from astrodrizzle
   when reaches total number of images, fire event
Write DOLPHOT pars
   write the dolphot parameter file for the target, including all images
   tag parameter file
   fire event
Run DOLPHOT
   run dolphot
   tag data products
   fire event
Phot fits table
   Use data products to generate a fits and/or hdf5 version of the phot file
   tag product
   fire event
Cull photometry
   Flag "bad" photometry in the catalog
   tag data products
   fire event
Make cmds
   Generate QA plots to assess success of run
   tag products
   fire event?
Further Analysis?
   Any next steps, if we can automate, such as looking for structures or dwarf galaxies, but these will likely require input from the rest of the team.
